# Searcher-depth-and-breadth-first

Overview

In this project, I implemented depth- and breadth-first search algorithms. I implemented not only find a goal, but find a complete solution â€” a path to a goal. I also implemented a solution validator. I developed these implementations on a search problem provided (a maze), and I modeled a simple puzzle (the 8-puzzle) as a search problem. Showed understanding of a solution validator for a general search framework. Demonstrated understanding of iterative versions of depth- and breadth-first search.
